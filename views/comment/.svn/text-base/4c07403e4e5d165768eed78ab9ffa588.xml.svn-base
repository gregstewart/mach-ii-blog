    Hi, I just installed the Bluedragon server on debian &amp; apache 1.3. Did exactly what you said. How do I know the Bluedragon is running OK when I start? and I cannot get a browser session on my XP box to connect to the linux/bluedragon box. I have allowed 192.168.0.3 during installation. but no luck. Please help! Sue
