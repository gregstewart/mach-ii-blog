Also your blog CSS is totally screwed up and almost unreadable in Safari and Firefox!  </yourcomment>		<date>{ts '2004-12-23 23:35:02'}</date>		<formatteddate>23, December 2004</formatteddate>		<publish>1</publish>	</comment>

    Hey Sean, thanks for the feedback... I am intrigued by the problems with FireFox, as I exclusively use it on both Windows and Linux. Would you mind sending me a screen shot? I'll see what I can do to accommodate Safari, thought this one could be tricky to debug, since I have no access to a OSX. As for the tip not working, hmm, I wonder if there is an issue/difference between the OSX implementation of FireFox and Windows/Linux? Thanks in advance! Cheers Greg
