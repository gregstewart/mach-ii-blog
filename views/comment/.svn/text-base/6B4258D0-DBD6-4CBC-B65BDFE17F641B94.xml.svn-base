		<yourcomment>Hello. 
I find alot of your material very interesting, and was wondering if it is possible for me to use your dissertation for my own research of Bulgakov's work. Did you ever come around to finish it? If so, can I please have access to it? 
You can contact me at vica93@hotmail.com. I will be waiting for your response. Thank you. Victoria Petrosyan.</yourcomment>
