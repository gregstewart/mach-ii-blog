		<yourcomment>I have installed this filter against the 'Merrimack' release of ColdFusion MX and encountered errors thereafter.

Just to let you know.

Pages are indeed compressed using the gzip algorithm, however 'Merrimack' appears to continually return error messages when requesting or refreshing a page.
