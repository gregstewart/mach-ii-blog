</link>		<yourcomment>    What you call information, i call rants! ehhe Yes, go forth and learn all there is about patterns - it so makes life a little easier when you can compare a problem against a pattern and go "Oh well it appears to sovle that problem, now for the code" - which typically you do code first and then see if it solved the problem? Its all good. I hope i don't post bad information and if I do i'll inform where i went wrong as i'm also just learning this stuff as i go.  </yourcomment>		<date>{ts '2004-12-17 05:27:56'}</date>		<formatteddate>17, December 2004</formatteddate>		<publish>1</publish>	</comment>
