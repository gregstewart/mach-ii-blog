    Funny. I was just thinking the same thing as the other guy ;) Cold Fusion DataTypes for Visio. Visio integration for ColdFusion Components would rock, too... I recently started using Coldfusion and it is like going back to the stone age as far as tools are concerned. Eclipse has a good IDE, but I would like to reverse engineer to Visio some cfc's that I have created... -Brice
