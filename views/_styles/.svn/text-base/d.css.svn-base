/*
	All of the presentation aspects of this site would not 
	have been possible without the work of Doug Bowman
	(www.stopdesign.com) for Adaptive Path.
	
	The stylesheets control all aspects of layout and this is 
	down a technique devised by Doug. I have simply turned
	the process into a dynamic one by building a PHP classes and 
	a ColdFusion Component to control the page layout. 
	
	Thank you to Doug for the innovation!!
